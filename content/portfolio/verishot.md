A simple verilog emulator and visualiser for first-year EEE students. This project was done in the context of my third-year *High Level Programming* module.

Hardware design tooling is notoriously hard to use, especially for beginners. We tried to make things easier for beginners by giving a way to quickly run and visualize verilog designs without having to deal with tools like Quartus or Vivado.
