description: Adding tracing to ghcide

I am currently participating in Google Summer of Code, under the haskell.org organisation. My project is to introduce tracing into *ghcide*, a Haskell language server, which gives editors IDE-like capabilities for Haskell projects. 

My project will allow developers of this tool to analyse its behaviour at runtime, enabling them to improve its performance. If I complete the project with time left over, I also hope to use the capabilities I have added to also improve the performance of the tool myself.
