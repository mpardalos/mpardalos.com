title: About me
---

Hey there. I'm Mike, hope you like my site.

I'm a second year Imperial College student in Electronic and Information
Engineering.

At the moment I'm mostly interested in **web development**, especially using
**static site generators** and the **JAMstack** --- this site is built using a static
site generator called [Pelican](https://getpelican.com)! I have also been
dabbling in **programming language design** and everything that goes along with
it (mostly type theory).

## How I work

While I do certainly enjoy the act of programming, I try to remain goal-oriented
and always use the smallest solution that solves the problem at hand. I always
try to establish a clear set of goals before starting any project and keep those
goals in mind while working.

I have also worked on a few team projects during which I discovered that I
thrive in a team environment and do my best to get the most out of every team
member by trying to be as inclusive as possible.

## What I know

### Languages
  * Python
  * Haskell
  * Javascript
  * Java
  * C#
  * HTML/CSS
  * Somewhat familiar with: Scala, C, C++
### Libraries and Frameworks
  * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
  * [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
  * [Pelican static site generator](https://getpelican.com)
  * [Umbraco CMS](https://umbraco.com)

## What I use

I have been a **vim** addict for years and don't believe I will ever recover.
Weirdly enough, my editor of choice has been **VSCode**. Obviously with the
VSVim plugin.

I'm also a **linux** user and feel mostly at home in the command line. I'm
familiar with command line **git**, and also enjoy using unix-y tools to solve
small daily problems (I have been working on my sed- and awk-foo recently)
