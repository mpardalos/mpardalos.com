Coffee brewing methods can be broadly split into two categories:

-   **Immersion** means that the coffee grounds steep freely in the water for as long as necessary. Similar to how tea is usually brewed
-   **Percolation** means that water runs through the coffee grounds, which usually sit on a filter of some sort. Espresso and drip coffee fall under this category
