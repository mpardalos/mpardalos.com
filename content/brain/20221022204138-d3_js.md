D3 (Data-Driven Documents) is a javascript framework for data visualisation. It is extremely flexible, due to the fact that, at its core, it is just a way to declaratively manipulate SVG.


## Selections and joins {#selections-and-joins}

As D3 is a declarative framework, there is no `d3.insert` or `d3.create` (at least that I know of) for creating SVG elements. Instead, you would use a `.selectAll()` with the selector matching the type of element you want to create, followed by `.data()`, to bind the data to that selector. At that point, you can call `.enter()` to create the svg elements. The benefit of this approach is that you also have the `.join()` method. This will, in addition to what `.enter()` would do, also remove SVG elements that do not have corresponding entries in the data and update the entries whose data has changed.
