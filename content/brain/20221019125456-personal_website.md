My personal website, hosted at [mpardalos.com](https://mpardalos.com). I am trying to implement as many {{< optionalref "Indie Web" "20211121143554-indie_web.md" >}} technologies as possible. The website is implemented as a static site generated with Hugo and hosted on {{< optionalref "Netlify" "20211102133516-netlify.md" >}}. I have applied the {{< optionalref "modular typography" "20220918224758-modular_typography.md" >}} system to the design.


## Adding Zettelkasten to site {#adding-zettelkasten-to-site}

I would like to publish my {{< optionalref "Zettelkasten" "20210222144816-zettelkasten.md" >}} on the website, as a {{< optionalref "Digital Garden" "20210223201941-digital_garden.md" >}}. I am not yet sure about the process that will be used for this, but here are some requirements/constraints

1.  Notes are kept in {{< optionalref "org-roam" "20210222144531-org_roam.md" >}}.
2.  Only publish specific, tagged notes. A lot of my notes (mostly work-related) need to be private.
3.  I can not host my notes publicly (see above)
4.  I want to keep notes out of git. Adding version control adds too much friction and is not really useful.

There are also some nice-to-haves

1.  Add a graph similar to org-roam-ui
2.  Auto-export on save in org-roam

Because of the above, I think that the solution will probably involve manually exporting my notes into markdown files, and then pushing those to the website.

Here is an elisp script to export the notes into markdown on the website, using `ox-hugo`

```elisp
(setq
 org-id-extra-files (org-roam-list-files)
 org-hugo-base-dir "/home/mpardalos/Documents/mpardalos.com"
 org-hugo-section "brain")
```

```elisp
(dolist (fil (org-roam--list-files org-roam-directory))
  (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect fil)
    (if (member "publish" (org-get-tags)) (org-hugo-export-wim-to-md))
    (kill-buffer)))
```

-   `org-id-extra-files` is needed to be able to resolve the id-based links that org-roam uses.


### Allowing for missing files {#allowing-for-missing-files}

The script above will only publish files tagged with "publish", however, that means that the links to non-publish files will be broken. Perhaps I can replace the hugo shortcode that ox-hugo uses with one of my own that still works with missing files.

Hugo links are generated by [org-hugo-link](~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/ox-hugo/ox-hugo.el). We could advise it to replace the `relref` links like this:

```elisp
(defvar mpardalos/org-hugo-relref-shortcode "optionalref"
  "The hugo shortcode to use for references. org-hugo uses 'relref' by default")

(defun mpardalos/org-hugo-use-alternative-relref (f &rest args)
  (replace-regexp-in-string
   "\\[\\(.*?\\)\\]({ {< relref \"\\(.*?\\)\" >}})"
   (format "{ {< %s \"\\1\" \"\\2\" >}}" mpardalos/org-hugo-relref-shortcode)
   (apply f args)))

(advice-add 'org-hugo-link :around #'mpardalos/org-hugo-use-alternative-relref)
```

We then have to implement the new shortcode in hugo.

```html
{ { if .Site.GetPage (.Get 1) }}
<a href="{ { relref . (.Get 1) }}">{ { .Get 0 }}</a>
{ { else }}
<span class="broken-link">{ { .Get 0 }}</span>
{ { end }}
```
