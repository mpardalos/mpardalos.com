There is a community of people who want to bring back the "old web", of independent, personal sites as an alternative to the corporate web. This includes a number of protocols and format to support linking between independent websites.

## Webmentions {#webmentions}

[Webmention W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/)

This is a way to show backlinks on a website from other websites.

This requires no intermediate server, and no one to be checking over all websites to find webmention. Everything is completely peer-to-peer.

To facilitate this, there is [webmention.io](https://webmention.io), which, essentially, provides webmentions hosting. You link to it as your webmention target, and it then provides you with a feed of all mentions of your site.


### Webmentions from silos {#webmentions-from-silos}

[Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) allows you to receive webmentions from Silos (twitter, reddit, facebook, etc.)
