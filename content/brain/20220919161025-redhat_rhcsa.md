## 4. Control Access to Files {#4-dot-control-access-to-files}


### Special permissions {#special-permissions}

-   `u+s` (suid)
    Use on executables, make it execute as the owning user, not the user that executes it
-   `g+s` (guid)
    On executables, make it execute as the owning group, not the group of the user that executes it.
    On directories, created files have their group match that of the directory
-   `o+t` (sticky)
    On directories, prevent users (even those with write access to the directory) from deleting or force-saving files owned by other users.

These can be set by chmod symbolically (`u+s`, `g+s`, and `o+t`) or numerically (suid=4, guid=2, sticky=1)


## 5. SELinux {#5-dot-selinux}

The core idea of SELinux is _Mandatory Access Control_ (MAC). This is in contrast to the _Discretionary Access Control_ (DAC) implemented by the standard permissions system.

Everything "resource entity" (files, processes, directories, etc) get a **SELinux context**. These contexts are referenced by **SELinux policies** to control access. Default policy is to forbid everything.

A SELinux context consists of:

-   user
-   role
-   type
-   security level

Example:

```text
$--------------$--------$-------------------$----
   unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0
$--------------$--------$-------------------$----
$ SELinux user $ role   $ type              $ security level
```

SELinux controls what processes can access what files. This is (usually?) done by allowing processes with a specific type context to access files with some other, specific, type context. E.g. processes with `httpd_t` type context (web servers) will be allowed to access files with `httpd_sys_content_t` type context.

```text
allow httpd_t httpd_sys_content_t:file (read write)
```

Many commands use a `-Z` option to show SELinux info.

```text
ps axZ
ls -Z
```

You can get/set SELinux enforcement using `getenforce~/~setenforce`, or with the `enforcing=` kernel parameter (`enforcing=0` for permissive, `enforcing=1` for enforcing). The `selinux=0` kernel parameter completely disables SELinux (and is the only way to do that in RHEL 9 and above).

SELinux configuration is controlled through `/etc/selinux/config`. Set `SELINUX=enforcing` or `SELINUX=permissive` in this file. See `man 5 selinux_config`.


### Controlling SELinux file contexts {#controlling-selinux-file-contexts}

File contexts are controlled through a central database of policies in `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files`.

When a file does not have a policy, it inherits the context of its parent directory.

You can set a file's context using one of:

restorecon
: Apply the SELinux policy to the file

chcon
: Directly change the context. Only recommended for debugging


### File context policies {#file-context-policies}

File contexts are defined as

```text
path_regex which_files context
```

For example,

```text
/var/www/cgi-bin(/.*)? all files sytem_u:object_r:httpd_sys_script_exec_t:s0
```

means that all files (including directories and regular files) in /​var/​www/​cgi-bin get the specified context. The `(/​.*)?` (called the _pirate_) usually appears in the path in policies.

Manage policies using `semanage fcontext`, provided by the package `policycoreutils-python-utils`

-   List all active policies with `semanage fcontext -l`
    Add `-C` to view customisations to the policy.

-   Delete a policy with `semanage fcontext -d`
-   Add a policy with `semanage fcontext -a`
    ```text
    semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/virtual(/.*)?'
    ```


### Booleans {#booleans}

Booleans are defined by application developers, along with policies, to enable optional SELinux-related behaviour.
They are usually documented in a `_selinux` manpage, e.g. the selinux booleans for `httpd` are documented in `httpd_selinux`. These manpages are provided by the `selinux-policy-doc` package.

Commands:

-   `getsebool`
-   `setsebool`
-   `semanage boolean`

All have good usage messages


### Investigate and Resolve SELinux Issues {#investigate-and-resolve-selinux-issues}

Troubleshooting notes:

-   Almost all applications in the RHEL distribution contain complete SELinux policies, so it's unusual for the policy to be issue.
-   The most common issue is an incorrect context on new, moved or copied files. This can easily be fixed when an applicable policy references the file location (with `restorecon`)
-   Messages about actions denied by SELinux are logged to `/​var/​log/​audit/​audit.log`, and `/var/log/messages`. The second messages includes an `sealert` command which can be used to get more info about the alert, **and suggestions for how to fix it**
-   You can get details about all logged SELinux alerts with `sealert -a`


### Commands {#commands}

`getenforce` / `setenforce`
: Set SELinux enforcement status

`restorecon`
: Set file contexts based on policy

`chcon`
: Set file context directly

`semanage fcontext -l`
: List file context policy

`semanage fcontext -a`
: Add a rule to file context policy

`semanage boolean`
: Manage booleans

`sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log`
: Get details on SELinux alerts


## 6. Tune System Performance {#6-dot-tune-system-performance}


### Kill processes {#kill-processes}


#### Process signals {#process-signals}

There are more, but these are the most common

| Signal | Name | Definition                                                  |
|--------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | HUP  | Sent when the controlling terminal is closed.               |
|        |      | Sometimes also used to reload config.                       |
| 2      | INT  | Sent by Ctrl-C                                              |
| 3      | QUIT | Similar to SIGINT, but adds a process dump. Sent by Ctrl-\\ |
| 9      | KILL | Terminate program. Cannot be handled                        |
| 15     | TERM | Default for `kill`. "Normal" termination                    |
| 18     | CONT | Resumes the process after STOP or TSTP                      |
| 19     | STOP | Suspend the process, **cannot** be handled                  |
| 20     | TSTP | Suspend the process, **can** be handled                     |

There are various commands to send signals:

-   `kill` signals one process by PID
-   `killall` signals N processes by name
-   `pkill` signals N processes by various criteria (same as `pgrep`)


#### Kicking users out {#kicking-users-out}

1.  Check who is logged in: `w`
2.  Send SIGTERM to the terminal they are on: `pkill -SIGTERM -t ttyN`
3.  If that doesn't work: Kill all their processes: `pkill -SIGKILL -u bob`


### Monitor process activity {#monitor-process-activity}


#### Monitor processes {#monitor-processes}

Check with `uptime`:

> [user@host ~]$ uptime
> 15:29:03 up 14 min, 2 users, load average: 2.92, 4.48, 5.20

-   Load average is reported as the load over the **last 1, 5 and 15 minutes**.
-   An idle CPU has a load of 0.


#### Real-time process monitoring (top) {#real-time-process-monitoring--top}

Key bindings

| Key     | Purpose                                        |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|

| Shift-w | Save display configuration                     |


### Adjust tuning profiles {#adjust-tuning-profiles}

The `tuned` daemon can do either **static tuning**, applying a tuning profile at startup, or **dynamic tuning**, where a monitor plug-in monitors the system and a tuning plug-in applies configuration based on that.

Dynamic tuning is disabled by default. It can be configured by the following options in `/etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf`:

| Option             | Effect                                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| dynamic_tuning=1   | Enable dynamic tuning                             |
| update_interval=10 | Set the interval (seconds) between tuning updates |

You can set the current profile using `tuned-adm profile <profile>`. Profiles are stored in `/usr/lib/tuned/*`


### Influence Process Scheduling (nice) {#influence-process-scheduling--nice}

Processes have a `nice` value. The higher it is, the lower the priority of the process. Values range from -20 to 19, default is 0.

Unpriviledged users are only allowed to increase the `nice` value of their own processes.

In top, the NI column shows nice value, and the PR column shows priority. For normally-scheduled processes, PR=NI+20, and negative numbers are reserved for real-time processes.


#### Setting nice values {#setting-nice-values}

-   Processes inherit niceness from their parent, which for the shell is usually 0.
-   You can start a process with a different nice value using `nice -n <val> <command>`.
-   You can change the niceness of a process using ~


### Commands {#commands}

`pstree`
: View processes as a tree

`w`
: Check active users

`kill`
: Send signal by PID

`pkill`
: Send signal by criteria

`kill %2`
: Kill job 2 in bash

`tunedadm`
: Control tuning profiles

`nice -n 15 prog`
: Start `prog` with a nice value of 15

`renice -n 19 4242`
: Set the nice value of PID 4242 to 19


## 7. Schedule Future Tasks {#7-dot-schedule-future-tasks}


### Schedule recurring user jobs (cron) {#schedule-recurring-user-jobs--cron}

Cron runs jobs periodically based on its configuration file, the _crontab_. If jobs have output, it is sent over email to the job owner.

Crontab lines follow this structure

```crontab
15 12 11 * Fri command
```

The fields appear in the following order:

-   Minutes
-   Hours
-   Day of month
-   Month
-   Day of week
-   Command

Day of the week and day of the month are in an OR relationship.

The fields can be defined in the following ways:

-   `*` for any possible value of the field
-   As a number.
    For days of the week, 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, ..., 7 is Sunday again
-   `x-y` for all values between x and y, inclusive
-   `x,y,z,...` for lists
-   `*/x` for an interval of x (e.g. repeat every 7 minutes)
-   3-letter english abbreviations for days of the week and months

Examples:

-   Run `/usr/local/bin/yearly_backup` on 3 February at 9:00 every year:
    ```text
    0 9 3 2 * /usr/local/bin/yearly_backup
    ```
-   Email "Chime" every five minutes between 9:00 and 16:00, on every Friday in July:
    ```text
    */5 9-16 * Jul Fri echo "Chime"
    ```
-   Run `/usr/local/bin/daily_report` every working day, 2 minutes before midnight
    ```text
    58 23 * * Mon-Fri /usr/local/bin/daily_report
    ```
-   Send an email with `mutt` every working day at 9:00
    ```text
    0 9 * * Mon-Fri mutt -s "Checking in" developer@example.com % Hi there, just checking in.
    ```


### Schedule recurring system jobs (cron) {#schedule-recurring-system-jobs--cron}

System-level jobs can be defined in a number of ways:

-   As a line in `/etc/crontab`
-   As a line in a file in `/etc/cron.d`, containing files with crontab syntax
-   As an executable script in one of
    -   `/etc/cron.hourly`
    -   `/etc/cron.daily`
    -   `/etc/cron.weekly`
    -   `/etc/cron.monthly`


#### Anacron {#anacron}

Anacron works similarly to cron, but ensures that commands run even if they weren't able to run at the scheduled time (e.g. if the machine was turned off).

It is controlled by `/etc/anacrontab`. Which has the following syntax:

```text
<period in days> <delay in minutes> <job identifier> <command>
```

Environment variable definitions can also appear before the jobs


### Schedule recurring system jobs (systemd timers) {#schedule-recurring-system-jobs--systemd-timers}

A Systemd timer unit activates a unit of another type (the one with the same name) on a timer.

Systemd timer units are placed along with all other systemd units: `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` for package-installed ones, and `/etc/systemd/system/` for user-provided ones.

Example: `sysstat-collect.timer`

```text
[Unit]
Description=Run system activity accounting tool every 10 minutes

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:00/10
```

This will trigger `sysstat-collect.service` every 10 minutes.
See `systemd.timer(5)` for more details on the syntax.

Timers can be enabled as any other systemd unit:

```sh
systemctl enable --now <unitname>.timer
```

Make sure to run `systemctl daemon-reload` when making any changes to unit files!


### Notes {#notes}

`/etc/crontab` Has a diagram for crontab syntax


### Commands {#commands}

`crontab`
: Manage cronjobs
    -   **`crontab <filename>`:** Replace crontab with &lt;filename&gt;


## 8. Install and Update Software Packages {#8-dot-install-and-update-software-packages}


### Register Systems for Red Hat Support {#register-systems-for-red-hat-support}

You can perform the following tasks relating to Red Hat Support. You can either use "Red Hat Subscription Manager" application or the `subscription-manager` command:

-   Register a system
    This essentially means attaching a system to your RedHat account.
-   Subscribe a system
-   Enable repositories
-   Review and track entitlements

There are also _Activation Keys_ that, apparently, can be used to directly register and subscribe a system to specific subscriptions with a file, without fiddling with subscription-manager.

Authentication for subscriptions is handled through certificates which are stored in `/etc/pki/`:

`/etc/pki/product`
: Installed Red Hat products

`/etc/pki/consumer`
: Red Hat account

`/etc/pki/entitlement`
: Attached subscriptions

#### Commands {#commands}

-   Register the system
    ```sh
    subscription-manager register --username <username>
    ```
-   Auto-attach a system
    ```sh
    subscription-manager attach --auto
    ```
-   Attach from a specific subscription pool
    ```sh
    subscription-manager attach --pool=<poolID>
    ```
-   View consumed subscriptions
    ```sh
    subscription-manager list --consumed
    ```
-   Unregister a system
    ```sh
    subscription-manager unregister
    ```


### Install and Update Software Packages with DNF {#install-and-update-software-packages-with-dnf}

You can list packages with `dnf list <glob>` (If you want a more accurate search than `dnf search`)

`dnf update <packagename>` updates a file. This tries to preserve _configuration files_, but if they need to be changed it will rename the old one and put the new one in its place.

There are also _groups_. List them with `dnf group list`, and `dnf group list hidden`

DNF keeps a transaction history in `/var/log/dnf.rpm.log`. Use `dnf history` to view it. The history will include IDs, which can be used to undo operations with `dnf history undo <ID>`, or roll back to a previous state using `dnf rollback <ID>`.


#### Module Streams {#module-streams}

In RHEL 9 there are _2 software repositories_:

-   BaseOS
    Contains core operating system packages (kernel, coreutils, etc)
-   Application Stream (AppStream)
    Contains "necessary parts of the system" as well as "a wide range of applications"

AppStream contains both RPM packages and **modules**. These are groups of related packages with multiple **module streams**. E.g. the module for `mysql` will have streams for `mysql` 10.1, 10.2,10.3, etc. You can enable one of these at a time to get a different version of mysql and surrounding packages. Modules also have **profiles**, which provide sub-groups of packages for different use-cases, such as client, server, development, etc. **Enabling the module installs its default profile by default**. You can choose a different profile or change it after it has been enabled.

Commands:

-   List modules
    ```sh
    dnf module list
    ```
-   List streams for a specific module
    ```sh
    dnf module list <module-name>
    ```
-   Show details for a specific module
    ```sh
    dnf module info <module-name>
    ```
-   Show which module provides a package
    ```sh
    dnf module provides <package-name>
    ```


### Enable DNF Software Repositories {#enable-dnf-software-repositories}

Using `dnf config-manager`, you can enable repos from purchased subscriptions.

Third-party repos can be added in two ways:

1.  Add a `.repo` file in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`
    This is the recommended way, and takes precedence.
2.  Add a `[repository]` section in `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`

You can perform the first method above using `dnf config-manager`:

```sh
dnf config-manager --add-repo="https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/9/Everything/x86_64/"
```

This will create a `.repo` file in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`, which you can then customise.

Some third-party repos will provide an RPM package to install them. This can be directly installed with RPM or DNF. E.g. to install EPEL:

```sh
rpm --import
http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-9
dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
```


#### Repository files {#repository-files}

```cfg
[content.example.com_rhel9.0_x86_64_rhcsa-practice_rht]
name=created by dnf config-manager from     http://content.example.com/rhel9.0/x86_64/rhcsa-practice/rht
baseurl=http://content.example.com/rhel9.0/x86_64/rhcsa-practice/rht
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

name
: Display name

baseurl
: Repo URL

enabled
: Whether this will show up in search results. You can install packages from this repo even if this is 0

gpgcheck
: Whether to check GPG signatures for packages downloaded from the repo


## 9. Manage Basic Storage {#9-dot-manage-basic-storage}


### Mount and unmount filesystems {#mount-and-unmount-filesystems}

-   List block devices
    ```sh
    lsblk
    ```
-   List block devices with more info (including UUID)
    ```sh
    lsblk -fp
    ```
-   Mount by device name
    ```sh
    mount /dev/<device-name> <path>
    ```
-   Mount by UUID
    ```sh
    mount UUID="<UUID>" <path>
    ```
-   Unmount path
    ```sh
    umount <path>
    ```
-   List open files within a path
    ```sh
    lsof <path>
    ```


### Add partitions, file systems, and persistent mounts {#add-partitions-file-systems-and-persistent-mounts}

-   Manage partitions using `parted`.
    Both for MBR and GPT
    -   It is recommended to start the first partition at a multiple of 2048 sectors
-   Detect newly created partitions using
    ```sh
    udevadm settle
    partprobe /dev/sd*
    ```
-   Format a partition using `mkfs.xfs` or `mkfs.ext4`
-   Persistently mount file systems by adding them to `/etc/fstab`
    -   It is recommended to use UUIDs instead of device names here.
    -   Apply the fstab on a live system with `systemctl daemon-reload`


### Manage swap space {#manage-swap-space}

-   Recommended swap space:

    | RAM        | Swap space | Swap space with hibernation |
    |------------|------------|-----------------------------|
    | &lt;2GB    | 2x RAM     | 3x RAM                      |
    | 2GB - 8GB  | RAM        | 2x RAM                      |
    | 8GB - 64GB | &gt; 4GB   | 1.5x RAM                    |
    | &gt;64GB   | &gt; 4GB   | Hibernation not recommended |
-   Create swap partition
    ```sh
    mkswap /dev/<device>
    ```
-   Activate swap space temporarily
    ```sh
    swapon /dev/<device>
    ```
-   Activate swap space in fstab
    ```cfg
    UUID=... swap swap defaults 0 0
    ```

    -   Set swap space priority. Default priority is -2
        ```cfg
        UUID=... swap swap pri=10 0 0
        ```

If there are multiple swap spaces available, they are used in series (once the first fills up, start using the next one). you can manually set a priority in fstab. **Highest** priority swap space is used first. If multiple swap spaces have the same priority, they are used in round-robin.


## 10. Manage Storage Stack {#10-dot-manage-storage-stack}


### Build LVM storage {#build-lvm-storage}

1.  Create partitions, setting the lvm flag, and their type to "Linux LVM"
    ```sh
    parted...
    ```
2.  Create physical volumes on those partitions
    ```sh
    pvcreate /dev/vdb1 /dev/vdb2
    ```
3.  Create a volume group
    ```sh
    vgcreate vg01 /dev/vdb1 /dev/vdb2
    ```
4.  Create logical volumes
    ```sh
    lvcreate -n lv01 -L 300M vg01
    ```

The logical volumes will be available in `/dev/vg01/lv{01,02}`, or `/dev/mapper/_vg01-lv{01,02}_/`


#### VDO (Virtual Data Optimizer) {#vdo--virtual-data-optimizer}

VDO provides block-level deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning.
To create a VDO volume, simply add `--type vdo` to `lvcreate`


### Check LVM status {#check-lvm-status}

Use `pvdisplay`, `vgdisplay`, and `lvdisplay`, for physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes, respectively.

There is also `pvs`, `vgs`, and `lvs` which show a terser version of the above.


### Grow LVM storage {#grow-lvm-storage}

All of this can be performed online

1.  Add space to the volume group (if necessary)
    1.  Create a partition and a physical volume for it
        ```sh
           parted /dev/vdb mkpart primary 1072MiB 1648MiB
           parted /dev/vdb set 3 lvm on
           udevadm settle
           pvcreate /dev/vdb3
        ```
    2.  Add the new PV to the VG
        ```sh
           vgextend vg01 /dev/vdb3
        ```
2.  Extend the logical volume
    -   Adding a specified amount of space (Use + sign)
        ```sh
        lvextend -L +500M /dev/vg01/lv01
        ```
    -   Setting the desired size (without + sign)
        ```sh
        lvextend -L 10G /dev/vg01/lv01
        ```
3.  Extend filesystem
    -   XFS. Specify the **mount point**. **FS has to be online**
        ```sh
        xfs_growfs /mnt/data
        ```
    -   Ext4. Specify the LV block device. FS can be online or offline
        ```sh
        resize2fs /dev/vg01/lv01
        ```

Swap must be taken offline to resize.

1.  `swapoff`
2.  Extend logical volume
3.  `mkswap`
4.  `swapon`


### Shrink a Volume Group {#shrink-a-volume-group}

To take a physical volume out of a volume group:

1.  Move data out of the PV
    ```sh
    pvmove /dev/vdb3
    ```
2.  Remove PV from VG
    ```sh
    vgreduce vg01 /dev/vdb3
    ```


### Delete LVM components {#delete-lvm-components}

1.  `umount` the filesystem
2.  Remove `fstab` entries
3.  Remove the component
    -   Logical Volume
        ```sh
        lvremove /dev/vg01/lv01
        ```
    -   Volume Group
        ```sh
        vgremove vg01
        ```
    -   Physical Volume
        ```sh
        pvremove /dev/vdb1
        ```

### Layered storage <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#layered-storage}

Storage in RHEL can be though of as a stack

-   Block device
    -   Multipath?
        -   Partition?
            -   RAID? (mdadm)
                -   LVM?
                    -   Filesystem/Raw storage

At each level there are multiple options, presented in this diagram:

### Stratis (technology preview) {#stratis--technology-preview}

Stratis is a "local storage management tool". You can add a number of block devices to a Stratis pool, and then create thinly provisioned filesystems directly on that pool. Stratis will take care of configuring all the intermediate layers (mdadm, LVM, creating XFS filesystems). You then manage storage using the stratis CLI.

-   Do not trust `df` sizes about Stratis-managed FSs. It will always report 1.0T (due to thin provisioning). Use the `stratis` CLI to check filesystem usage instead.
-   When adding a Stratis FS to fstab, it needs the `x-systemd.requires=stratisd.service` option.
    ```cfg
    UUID=c7b57190-8fba-463e-8ec8-29c80703d45e /dir1 xfs defaults,x- systemd.requires=stratisd.service 0 0
    ```
    **The system won't boot otherwise**
-   Stratis can create snapshots of filesystems. These show up as block devices, as if they were another filesystem.


#### Commands {#commands}

-   Install and enable stratis
    ```sh
    dnf install stratis-cli stratisd
    systemctl enable --now stratisd
    ```
-   Create a stratis pool from a number of block devices
    ```sh
    stratis pool create pool1 /dev/vdb /dev/vdc
    ```
-   Add a block device to a pool
    ```sh
    stratis pool add-data pool1 /dev/vdd
    ```
-   Create a filesystem on a pool
    ```sh
    stratis filesystem create pool1 fs1
    ```
-   Take a filesystem snapshot
    ```sh
    stratis filesystem snapshot pool1 fs1 snapshot1
    ```
-   Delete storage
    -   Delete a filesystem (or snapshot)
        ```sh
        stratis filesystem destroy pool1 fs1
        ```
    -   Delete a pool
        ```sh
        stratis pool destroy pool1
        ```
-   Get info about stratis
    -   List pools
        ```sh
        stratis pool list
        ```
    -   List block devices in pools
        ```nil
        stratis blockdev list
        ```
    -   List filesystems
        ```nil
        stratis filesystem list
        ```

## 11. Control Services and Boot Process {#11-dot-control-services-and-boot-process}


### Boot targets {#boot-targets}

Different targets let you initialise the system to different levels to troubleshoot various issues.

`graphical.target`
: Start system all the way to GUI

`multiuser.target`
: Fully start system, but without a GUI, just text login

`rescue.target`
: `sulogin` prompt, basic system initialisation complete

`emergency.target`
: `sulogin` prompt, initramfs pivot complete and system root mounted on `/` read-only.

Ways of choosing a target

-   Select a target at runtime
    ```sh
    systemctl isolate <target>.target
    ```
-   Set a default target
    ```sh
    systemctl set-default <target>.target
    ```
-   Select a target at boot time: Add this to the kernel command line
    ```cfg
    systemd.unit=<target>.target
    ```


### Reset the root password {#reset-the-root-password}

1.  Stop boot at the initramfs stage, by adding `rd.break` to the kernel command line. If it is available, you need to use the **rescue kernel** for this.
2.  Remount the system as read-write at `/sysroot`
    ```sh
    mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
    ```
3.  Chroot into the system, mounted at `/sysroot`
    ```sh
    chroot /sysroot
    ```
4.  Change the root password
    ```sh
    passwd
    ```
5.  Make sure that all unlabeled files, including `/etc/shadow`, get relabeled during boot. (Something about SELinux?)
    ```sh
    touch /.autorelabel
    ```
6.  Exit and reboot
    ```sh
    exit
    exit
    ```


### Systemctl Commands {#systemctl-commands}

-   List dependencies
    ```sh
    systemctl list-dependencies <unit>
    ```
-   (Un)mask a unit. Useful if 2 units are conflicting and you don't want to enable one by accident
    ```sh
    systemctl <mask|unmask> <unit>
    ```
