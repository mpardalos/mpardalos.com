Welcome to my brain! This is a collection of interconnected notes that I use for just about everything. Some have more attention put into them than others, but the entire collection develops over time as I learn about new things, adding notes, or deepen into topics I have previously explored, expanding existing notes.

Hopefully you can find something interesting!
