There are three types of flavours that we can look for or avoid in coffee: Body, acidity and fermented flavours. There are also words that are used to describe the presence or absence of these flavours.


## Body {#body}

-   Full: Creamy, rich
-   Medium: None of the above
-   Light: delicate, elegant, tea-like, floral words


## Acidity {#acidity}

-   High: Citrus, berries
-   Medium-high: Apple, pear
-   Low: Cooked fruits, Jam
-   Very low: None of the above, caramel, nuts, chocolate


## Fermented fruit {#fermented-fruit}

Unusual, can be found sometimes. I don't think I have ever tasted this.

-   High: Tropical fruits, e.g. Pineapple, Mango, Strawberry.
    Also: "dry process", "natural process"
