[YUnoHost](https://yunohost.org) is a package to make it easy to self-host a number of services on a variety of platforms.

-   [Supported platforms](https://yunohost.org/en/install) include the raspberry pi and VPS running Debian
-   [Applications](https://yunohost.org/en/apps) are easy (possibly one-click) to install, and include things like NextCloud, Wordpress, and matrix servers.

This project seems very interesting to me as it takes away a lot of the work needed for a "normal person" to self-host services. It would be especially interesting combined with {{< optionalref "Indie Web" "20211121143554-indie_web.md" >}} technologies, to make it possible for more people to host IndieWeb-style websites.
