This is a component that allows for quickly writing various kinds of diagrams. Importantly for my use, it is part of {{< optionalref "org-mode" "20211027212850-org_mode.md" >}}.

## Using in Org mode {#using-in-org-mode}

You can create a PlantUML diagram using a source code block, as follows:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/plantuml_example.png" >}}

Importantly, you need to set the `:file` attribute, and make sure it has an image file extension (e.g. ".png"), to make sure emacs displays the image.
