I have water cooled my personal desktop PC. It is a soft-tube loop for the CPU and GPU, with a single 240mm radiator and an alphacool eisbaer reservoir-pump-cpu block combo.


## Planning {#planning}

I am considering water cooling my desktop computer, mainly for noise reasons. Here I explain my plans and thoughts about this.


### Requirements (in order) {#requirements--in-order}

1.  Loop must cover the graphics card
2.  Don't have a bunch of tools left over that I will never use again
3.  Should look cool
4.  Loop should be liquid temperature controlled to reduce noise as much as possible.


### Soft or hard tubing {#soft-or-hard-tubing}

Hardline tubing would look great, however I don't think it's worth the money and hassle.

| Option             | Price | Safety | Difficulty | Looks | Tools | Score |
|--------------------|-------|--------|------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Soft               | 3     | 3      | 3          | 1     | 3     | 13    |
| Hard with bends    | 2     | 2      | 1          | 3     | 1     | 9     |
| Hard with fittings | 1     | 1      | 2          | 2     | 2     | 8     |

But it would look so cool...


### Part selection {#part-selection}

I am choosing parts from Scan.co.uk, as they seem to have the best availability. I will look around some more once I have a good idea of the parts I want.
