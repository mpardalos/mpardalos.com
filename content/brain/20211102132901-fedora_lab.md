This is a server I **had** set up as a lab to experiment with.

-   Hosting: {{< optionalref "Linode" "20211102130137-linode.md" >}}


## Running applications {#running-applications}

-   Syncthing
-   {{< optionalref "Cockpit" "20211102130254-cockpit.md" >}}


## Configuration {#configuration}

-   Host: Linode's basic $5 / 1 Core / 1 GiB node


### DNS {#dns}

Because the domain is managed by {{< optionalref "Netlify" "20211102133516-netlify.md" >}} to use for my personal site, I have had to set up the domain record there. This is a bit annoying, and I would prefer a different solution.

Alternatives:

1.  Buy a new domain and use that for labs only.
2.  Move all DNS records to Hover, my DNS provider.
3.  Deal with it

Leaning towards (3) for now.


## Errors {#errors}


### `mcelog` fails to start {#mcelog-fails-to-start}

-   Description

    > Machine Check Exception Logging Daemon

-   Error message:

    > mcelog: ERROR: AMD Processor family 23: mcelog does not support this processor.  Please use the edac_mce_amd module instead.

This was reported here: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1069652>
It seems like what is needed here is to disable `mcelog` and instead load the `edac_mce_amd` kernel module instead. However, that is not present on the machine, maybe I just need to install it. **Still investigating**
