A digital garden is a sort of personal wiki, where one's ideas can be stored, linked, and indexed.
It is closely related to the {{< optionalref "Zettelkasten" "20210222144816-zettelkasten.md" >}}, and "second brain" ideas.

It can be put to a lot of uses, and I'm still figuring out what I want to do with mine. I do want to keep one for sure, however.

@swyx has a great page on [Digital Garden Terms of Service ∊ swyx.io](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/), where he outlines some expectations for digital garden visitors and gardeners.


## Ideas for my garden {#ideas-for-my-garden}

-   I like Maggie Appleton's tagging of notes as seedling/budding/evergreen. Steal that.
-   I like the three-piece layout from [Neil's Digital Garden](https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/)
-   Make sure there is an abundance of small notes and index pages


## Other people's gardens {#other-people-s-gardens}

Here's a list of people's gardens I've found online. Quite a few come from [ this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1250532315459194880%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftomcritchlow.com%2F2020%2F05%2F19%2Ftiddlywiki-krystal%2F).

-   [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)
    Incredibly professional looking. Great for inspiration/input but not close to my goals in itself. I like her tagging each note as Seedling/Budding/Evergreen

-   [Tom Critchlow. Move. Think. Create.](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/)
-   [Summaries, Notes, and Lessons from Books I've Read](https://www.nateliason.com/notes)
-   [Chris Biscardi's Digital Garden](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/)
    Very curated, professional looking, but somehow still hard to get to the interesting stuff. Looks good but not really my style.

-   [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
    From [Andy Matuschak's main site](https://andymatuschak.org/):

    > Hi! I’m a software engineer, designer, and researcher. I work on technologies that expand what people can think and do.

    I really like this. I love the ideas presented and it honestly feels like a set of working, mostly evergreen notes. I will be coming back to this.
-   [My Brain - Aengus McMillin](https://aengusmcmillin.com/brain/brain)
    Looks interesting, but somewhat hard to navigate and light on content. Maybe I should come back to this.

-   [Your friend Joel's digital garden](https://joelhooks.com)
    I like the stuff presented here relating to digital gardens but the rest of the content is not really my thing. Also, I can't find the small notes which is what I find most interesting.

-   [Neil's Digital Garden](https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/) (DoubleLoop)
    I absolutely adore this. This is goals (as the kids say). Especially like the three-piece layout.
