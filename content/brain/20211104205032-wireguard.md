A VPN server for linux. Setting it up on a Raspberry Pi would be a good way to get access to the home network.


## Resources {#resources}

## Setup {#setup}

I have set everything up using [wg-easy](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy/), which makes it easy (heh) to add new peers to a wireguard instance.
