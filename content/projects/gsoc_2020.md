I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020, under the haskell.org organisation. My project was centered around *ghcide*, a project which gives editors IDE-like capabilities for Haskell code, using the Language Server Protocol. I introduced tracing into this software to facilitate profiling its performance.

The project was completed and the functionality was included in the project. This required me to dive deep into the internals of the Haskell compiler (GHC) to be able to measure the size of Haskell objects in memory, and resulted in merging a [patch to GHC](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/3738). As I used OpenTelemetry to implement the tracing feature, I also [contributed to the haskell OpenTelemetry library](https://github.com/ethercrow/opentelemetry-haskell/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3Ampardalos)
