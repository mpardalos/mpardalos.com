## PhD

I am currently in the second year of my PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London.

I started my PhD working on a project to find bugs in [Equivalence Checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_equivalence_checking). The results of this project have been submitted for publication to DAC 2024.

I am interested in continuing work on the field of equivalence checking, and I am currently investigating building an equivalence checker based on the [CIRCT framework](https://circt.llvm.org/).

I will be attending in [POPL 2024](https://popl24.sigplan.org/).

## Side-projects

My focus is currently on this website. I have grown really interested in the ideas of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) community, as well as Digital Gardens. This website is inspired by both of these concepts. 

I also spend quite a bit of time working on my [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), trying out different software
