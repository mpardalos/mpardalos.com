title: What am I doing?

## PhD

I am currently in the first year of my PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London.

As part of my PhD I am currently working on a project to find bugs in Formal Equivalence Checkers for hardware designs. I am planning on writing about this project once I have made sufficient progress.

## Side-projects

My focus is currently on this website. I have grown really interested in the ideas of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) community, as well as Digital Gardens. What you see here is heavily inspired by both of these concepts.
