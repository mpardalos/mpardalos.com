## Work

I am impatiently waiting to start a PhD in the Electrical Engineering
department in Imperial College London, under Dr John Wickerson.

While the topic has not been decided yet, it will most likely be at the
intersection of hardware design and formal methods, following from my
previous work on \"Resource sharing for verified high-level synthesis\"
([DOI](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/FCCM53951.2022.9786208)).
