Hey there. I'm Michalis, hope you like my site!

{{< fig src="/images/myself.png" class="my-face" width=300em >}}

I'm a recent graduate of *Electronic and Information Engineering* from *Imperial
College London*. This degree has allowed me to develop skills in hardware
design, software engineering and systems architecture. I have also acquired
significant research experience for an undergraduate (see my [CV](/cv.pdf)), and
I am now looking to apply my skills — and acquire new ones — in an applied,
industrial environment.

I always like to keep myself occupied with a side project. I am currently
working on an programming language called
[Kima](https://gitlab.com/michalis_pardalos/Kima): A statically typed language
with algebraic effects. I am very interested in the study of programming languages, and how they can be used to improve software correctness.
