I absolutely loved this movie. There have been very few films that have affected me as deeply. The film uses the idea of parallel worlds as a vehicle to talk about existentialism in a way that I found incredibly relatable, and gave me a lot to think about for the next couple of days. As if that were not enough, the film is absolutely *hilarious* throughout. I cannot recommend this enough.
