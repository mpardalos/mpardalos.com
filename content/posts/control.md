I only started playing this game recently, but I am intrigued --- being mostly drawn in by the game's plot. There is some MK-Ultra-esque government conspiracy around some sort of paranormal alternate universe. It's too early to have figured out the details, but the way the game progressively reveals information has caught my interest. 

As for the gameplay --- it is a shooter with some fun twists. You get some extra abilities to go with the single gun the game gives you: a "force push", which deals heavy damage, and telekinesis, which is *incredibly* fun to use. It works like the gravity gun from Half Life 2: you grab items from the world and throw them at enemies to deal *massive* damage. It's great. 

I'm curious to see where this game goes!
