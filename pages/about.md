title: About me

Hey there. I'm Mike, hope you like my site.

I'm a third year Imperial College student in Electronic and Information
Engineering.

At the moment I'm mostly interested in programming language theory, type theory.
I'm currently working on an experimental programming language called
[Kima](https://gitlab.com/michalis_pardalos/Kima), a statically typed language
with algebraic effects. From time to time I also dabble in front-end development
and enjoy working with static website generators and the JAMstack.

## What I use

I have been a **vim** addict for years and don't believe I will ever recover.
After a brief time with VSCode I have become an **Emacs** convert, even though
it's basically impossible for me to use it without the **evil** plugin.

I'm also a **linux** user and feel mostly at home in the command line. I'm
familiar with command line **git**, and also enjoy using unix-y tools to solve
small daily problems (I have been working on my sed- and awk-foo recently)
